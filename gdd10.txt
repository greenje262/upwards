[UPWARDS]

Core mechanic
    Climbing a tower and making a final choice at the end

Core gameplay loop
    Climb a flight of stairs, read the story, repeat
    At the end, choose to quit the game or jump from the tower

Intended player experience
    Short, thoughtful

Theme
    Dark, somber

Primary features
    Tower stairs (spiral stairs? on rails?)
    Door closes between floors
    Writing on the walls
    Parapet at the top

Secondary features
    Bottom floor
    Music, wind, and footsteps

Polish
    Title screen
    Door closing animation

What do I need to learn?
    How to make climbable stairs
    Texturing walls and lighting

Workflow
    Write the script, broken up by floor
    Set up player and movement
    Set game to quit upon player reaching a certain y value (the fall), or on button press
    Build the stairs, and teleport the player to the bottom set of stairs when they reach the top set
    Set up textures and lights on the stairs and hallway
    Build the wall text, and set it to cycle through the script
    Build the parapet at the top of the stairs, overlooking a city
    Set teleporter to end upon exhausting the text, and door to close behind player in parapet
    Find and implement music and footsteps, replacing music with wind at the top of the parapet
    Create a bottom floor rotunda

Other notes
    Should the shit be on rails?
    Should I have a voiceover coupled with writing on the wall?
